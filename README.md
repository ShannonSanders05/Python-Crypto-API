## Project Title: Python-Crypto-API

Description:

In this Python project, I developed an automated solution to extract cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap using their API. The project encompasses the following key features:

1. **API Integration**: Leveraged the CoinMarketCap API to dynamically fetch real-time cryptocurrency data, including prices, market capitalization, and trading volumes.
2. **Automated Data Retrieval**: Implemented a Python script to automate the periodic checking of the CoinMarketCap site for updated cryptocurrency information.
3. **Data Extraction and Processing**: Extracted relevant data from the API response, processing it into a structured format for analysis.
4. **CSV Export**: Designed the script to export the extracted cryptocurrency data into a CSV file, enabling easy integration with various data analysis tools.
5. **Scheduled Execution**: Utilized scheduling tools or cron jobs to automate the periodic execution of the script, ensuring up-to-date data at predefined intervals.
